# Use Class/Object File (Perl)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Perl projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/perl-importclass
  cd perl-importclass
  perl main.pl
  ```
*Formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
